_Description: JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files
 Due to import control restrictions of some countries,
 the JCE jurisdiction policy files shipped with this package
 allow "strong" but limited cryptography to be used.
 An "unlimited strength" version of these files indicating no
 restrictions on cryptographic strengths is available for
 those living in eligible countries (which is most countries).
 You download this version and replace the strong cryptography
 versions supplied with this package with the unlimited ones.
 .
 The Java(TM) Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength
 Jurisdiction Policy Files 1.4.2 are available at

_Description: Grant the "stopThread" RuntimePermission?
 This permission allows any thread to stop itself using the
 java.lang.Thread.stop() method that takes no argument.
 .
 Note that this permission is granted by default only to
 remain backwards compatible. It is strongly recommended that
 you either not grant this permission at all or restrict it
 manually in java.policy to code sources that you specify,
 because Thread.stop() is potentially unsafe.
 .
 See "http://java.sun.com/notes" for more information.
